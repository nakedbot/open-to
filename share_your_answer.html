<p>We want to hear how sharing scholarship more openly is making the world a better place. There are a couple of ways to do that!</p>

<h2>Share an existing story with us</h2>

<h2>Write a story</h2>

<p>
  Got a story you think the world needs to hear? We bet you do! Nothing is too small, or too specific, to show the impact open can have. If you want to share your story write up a short draft and send it over using the form. We'll work with you go get it posted. Anything you share with us we'll license under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY 4.0</a>.
