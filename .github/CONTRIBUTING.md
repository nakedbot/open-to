## Updating the site (for SPARC staff)

### User management:
If you want someone else to have full access to editing, we give them access on Github. You can stratify access quite well. I've given you access to this version so you can test the below, which is on my personal account (anything we do here can be quickly ported to the SPARC account, but since I was just playing atm I hadn't done that).

### If making a redirect

  * Decide a title, description & slug
  * Find an image to appear on the frontpage & put it [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/tree/master/assets/images).
  * Get the link you want to redirect to
  * Go [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/tree/master/_posts) and make a new file (this can be done locally or via the web UI). Draft posts can be signalled in the file so that they don't go onto the site.
  * Follow [this template](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/blob/master/_posts/2016-8-23-magna.md)

### If making a site blog

  * Decide a title, description & slug
  * Find an image to appear on the frontpage & put it [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/tree/master/assets/images)
  * Go [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/tree/master/_posts) and make a new file (this can be done locally or via the web UI on that page). Draft posts can be signalled in the file so that they don't go onto the site.
  * Follow [this template](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-to/blob/master/_posts/2016-04-10-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown). A post can be put in plain HTML or Markdown (in most cases the edits required here would be easy & fast, e.g replacing links or putting in a few headers, often what you'd need to do in other programs anyway).
  * "commit" the file, with either .md or .html depending on whatever language you used.

### Sorting posts on the front page and other feeds

  * Every post needs a weight to show up on the front page. You can set this when you post, or whenever after you post.
  * A post can have the same weight as another post. If it does, I'd guess that date matters (haven't tested this)
